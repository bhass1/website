<b>[1:50am]:</b> Great, first thing's first. Install [Ruby+Devkit] so I can actually compile all the Jekyll shit so the post actually shows up on the main page.<br/>
<a href="https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/">Go ahead, you can play along.</a><br/>
<br/>
<b>[1:54am]:</b> While downloading Ruby, I checked out the license in the badge's SDK from the manufacturer's website. <a href="assets/Specialized Solutions LLC License Agreement.txt">You can read it here.</a> Any lawyer out there who can decode if this is a good thing or bad thing.. seems very restrictive to my untrained eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<b>[2:00am]:</b> Wife came to tell me to get to bed. Better get to bed! But first, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/windows/">I'm installing Jekyll finally after following these easy instructions.</a> Cool.<br/>
<br/>
<b>[9:00am]:</b> Well, now I know why I never write blogs. This is supposed to be on the CHV badge, but I haven't even successfully created a new post yet. I forgot to mention that "jekyll build" puked on "é" when I ran it last night.<br/>
<img src="assets/andre.png"> < -- It doesn't like the fancy-ass 'e'<br/>
<img src="assets/jekyll_error.png"><br/>
After a quick fix (set 'fancy-ass e' to 'e') the "jekyll build" was satisfied, but my post still isn't showing up on my site after pushing the gh-pages branch. I wonder if I didn't create a necessary link somwhere....<br/>
<br/>
<b>[10:14am]:</b> Okay, I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxua_1vyFck&index=4&list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB">some Youtubez</a> and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/">poked around some docs</a>. While I was at it, I renewed my domain with my DNS provider and configured HTTPS. It was easy, and I think the folks over at <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt!</a>have something to do with it. Huge shout out!!! w00t w00t!! <br/>
Back to the Jekyll issue... I am thinking it's a build problem so I need to build it locally with something like "bundle exec jekyll serve".<br/>
<br/>
<b>[12:39pm]:</b> Time flies when you're having fun! /sarcasm. Okay so maybe I learned a few things, but I haven't gotten very far on my actual goal of reverse engineering this badge. I have figured out how this Jekyll shit works. Things mostly were broken just becuase they were old. I used jekyll to create a new test website from scratch. Then I brought in the post I am working on to see if it would render there, and voila! It did. So I copied over the newer Jekyll files like _config.yml and index.md. Then reorganized things. Messed with the 404.html (Check it out!: <a href="/404.html">404 ERROR!</a>), committed my paperclips and gum website, and pushed it up to gh-pages.<br/>

<h4> ENOUGH WITH THE ADMIN!!! TIME TO HACK!</h4>

I took some pics! The badge comes with an OBD-II connector for plugging directly into an internal combustion engine vehicle. You can find the connector under your steering wheel in most vehicles. <br/>
<img src="assets/badge_obdii.jpg" width="250"/>
<br/>
I noticed it uses one of NXP's S32K series MCUs. That's great because I am using a variant of that chip at work! The exact number is: <b><i>FS32K148HFVLQ</b></i>.<br/> I also looked up each chip and marked the following image to make life easier. <br/>

<br/>
<b>[2:04pm]:</b> The pictures are uploaded and marked. I will come back with a table of each component with links to the supplier's website. <br/>
<br/>
<b>[2:16pm]:</b> Hahahahaha. This is great! 12 hours later and I find that <a href="http://www.specsolns.com/dc2018-can.html"> I need to hack the badge before CAN will even work in the first place!!</a> Well played, DEFCON CHV badge people; Well played. <br/>
Let's see, we need a hardware change and a software change. I can't believe the author even listed "Option 3 - No CAN needed." Really? You're going to suggest we don't use CAN in automotive applications?? That's golden.<br/>
<br/>
<b>[2:57pm]:</b> After a short break, I went into researching JTAG devices so I can flash the provided hex to the S32 and get CAN working. Looks like I have a few options: <br/>
1. Segger J-Link EDU: <a href="https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Segger-Microcontroller/J-Link-EDU?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvu8NZDyZ4K0dwf6o9Xeg1V"> Mouser URL ($60.00) </a><br/>
2. P&E Micro Multilink Universal: <a href="http://www.pemicro.com/products/product_viewDetails.cfm?product_id=15320168&productTab=5"> PE Micro URL ($199.00)</a><br/>
3. Bus Pirate + OpenOCD: <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/237"> Adafruite URL ($30.00) </a><br/>
<br/>
The Bus Pirate option has <a href="https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2014/05/01/jtag-debugging-made-easy-with-bus-pirate-and-openocd/">a promising looking guide online </a> and feels good on the wallet. Plus I can do a bunch of things like I2C and SPI with it. I have used it in the past for writing <a href="https://github.com/Heavy-Vehicle-Networking-At-U-Tulsa/cthwre">a hardware reverse engineering course</a> for the <a href="http://www.cybertruckchallenge.org/">1st Annual CyberTruck Challenge</a>, but I remember it being a pretty big pain in the neck.

<b>[9:47pm]:</b>The hack to fix CAN on the CHV badge is two parts: (1) Hardware and (2) Software. So I did some solder work since my last post:<br/>
1. Ground PIN 2 on all of the CAN Transceivers (NXP TJA1057). So that means three pretty small solder joints. Make sure you have a small tip! I used a 1/32" pitch cone tip. Just take your time, get solder on the tip and solder on the patch wire. I think enamled copper wire is meant for this kind of stuff, but jumper wires actually work just fine in most cases, so I went with that. <br/>
2. Solder a 5-pin male header to the S32K JTAG port. I've had to do this type of solder joint tens of times while building my fpv quadcopters, it's a very common solder joint... This one will benefit from flux because it will help the solder flow down into the cylindrical hole of the PCB. Put a little on the tips of the header before you push it in. Use any random thing to prop the pins up so you can solder them in place. I kinda F*@keD up because I didn't use any and got some fat solder joints. <br/>
<br/>
It's not pretty, but it should get the job done.<br/>
<br/>
Time to get BusPirate configured. I have a Bus Pirate 4.0 and <a href="https://research.kudelskisecurity.com/2014/05/01/jtag-debugging-made-easy-with-bus-pirate-and-openocd/"> will be following the link I referenced above</a>.

<b>[10:30pm]:</b> Oh boy! According to <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/docs/Bus_Pirate_v4_vs_v3_comparison#Support_.26_development">the BusPirate website</a>, Bus Pirate v4.0 hardware does not support OpenOCD JTAG.... :((((( <br/>
<br/>
But have no fear! <a href="http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=8498">Bus Pirate Community Firmware 7.0 to the rescue??</a> Could it be?!<br/>
<br/>
I noticed the blog was posted back in 2016 (2 years ago) so I took a look at the bleeding edge in github. <br/>
[insert knife picturehere] <br/>
<br/>
It looks like there's <a href="https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate/issues/103">a recent issue on Github about not getting BP V4.0 and OpenOCD to work.</a><br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, they whipped out the logic analyzer. They aren't messing around! This is what I like to see. <br/>
[insert image of github post]
AND FIXED IT!!!! <br/>
<br/>
[insert celebration gif]<br/>
<br/>
[insert github fux]<br/>
WOOOO!!! Time to pull it down and give it a spin! There is <a href="https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate/blob/master/Documentation/building-and-flashing-firmware.md">a guide here</a>.<br/>
<br/>
git clone https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate.git<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
wget http://www.microchip.com/mplabxc16linux<br/>
chmod +x xc16-v1.35-full-install-linux-installer.run<br/>
sudo ./xc16-v1.35-full-install-linux-installer.run<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<b>[11:20pm]:</b> Time to get the IDE going... <br/>
wget http://www.microchip.com/mplabx-ide-linux-installer<br/>
tar -xvf MPLABX-v5.05-linux-installer.tar (this one takes a while, just let it work)<br/> 
chmod +x MPLABX-v5.05-linux-installer.sh
sudo ./MPLABX-v5.05-linux-installer.sh

<br/>
<br/>
64 Bit, check libraries<br/>
Check for 32 Bit libraries<br/>
These 32 bit libraries were not found and are needed for MPLAB X to run:<br/>
libexpat.so<br/>
libX11.so<br/>
libXext.so<br/>
<br/>
For more information visit http://microchip.wikidot.com/install:mplabx-lin64<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

[insert failed install image]

<br/>
NOTE: You may need different libraries than what I list below. Follow <a href="http://microchipdeveloper.com/install:mplabx-lin64">the Microchip guide here for installing the IDE in linux</a>.<br/>
<br/>
sudo apt-get install libexpat1:i386 libx11-6:i386 libxext6:i386<br/>
<br/>
<b>[11:36pm]:</b> Finally I ran the IDE installer and it is actively installing...<br/>
[insert image of installing #4]
<b>[11:41pm]:</b> Argghh!! VM ran out of storage!!!!! It had a 32 GB drive..
[insert image of failed install]
Most of the install is located at /opt/microchip as far as I can tell by using "Disk Usage Analyzer." Just select it from the GUI's search option. So I removed the installed bits so my computer had a chance to breathe. I couldn't save this file or do much of anything without warnings and complaints that there was no disk space to do anything (e.g. tab-complete in Bash didn't work - probably because it needed to create a file-based cache and couldn't). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
sudo rm -r /opt/microchip
<br/>
<h3>Sept. 2, 2018</h3>
<b>[12:15am]:</b> As it turns out, I had a rather large buildroot with full linux and application source just hanging around, so I zipped it up and gained a surprising amount of space. It went from 8.8GB to 2.5GB - I gained 6.3GB; Cool!<br/>
I ran into an error after following the build steps.
<b>[12:41am]:</b> So it turns out that when I removed /opt/microchip, I also blew away the compiler that I installed first. SO...
<br/>
First, I had to re-install the XC16 compiler. Second, I configured the IDE to point at the XC16 compiler. 

Finally...

[insert picture of BUILD SUCCESSFUL and rageface]

Now to put the Bus Pirate v4.0 into bootloader mode, I was able to simply type '$' into the serial console and hit enter. Then I closed the connection. <br/>
<a href="https://github.com/BusPirate/Bus_Pirate/blob/master/Documentation/building-and-flashing-firmware.md">The github guide says to use the pirate-loader_lnx</a>, but I can't find it. So I need to build it. Lucky for us the source is included already, so navigate into the folder and run make.

<br/><br/>
cd ~/source/Bus_Pirate/package/BPv4-firmware
ls
cd pirate-loader-v4-source
make
./pirate-loader_lnx --dev=/dev/ttyACM0 --hex=~/source/Bus_Pirate/Firmware/busPirate.X/dist/BusPirate_v4/production/busPirate.X.production.hex
<br/><br/>

<b>[1:36am]:</b> Okay, no success.. it kept failing. Time to try in Windows...<br/>
<br/>
[insert agony picture]

<br/>
<br/>
Yaaaay, it worked!<br/>
<br/>

<b>[1:43am]</b> Bed b4 2am. Hoping for JTAG connection tomorrow...
