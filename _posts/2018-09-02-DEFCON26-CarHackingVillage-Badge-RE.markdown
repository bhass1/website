Hello World. 

Long time since my last update. Life has a way of making you choose to spend your time on things you love because you don't have much of it. Indeed I love RE, but not blogging. Alas, here I am. Why not? 

I wrote a basic CAN fuzzer in Python back around May 2016 while in grad school. [Here it is: PyFuzz_CAN.][pyfuzz-git] I needed a quick and easy way to fuzz the network of a commercial class-8 tractor (aka. the front part of a semi-truck) for [a paper I later published][woot-trucks] with two classmates (Leif and Liza) and advisor [(André)][andre-web]. The tool needs some attention for sure, but I'll get to that some other day.


Since then, a lot has happened. I now work at [Lear Corporation][lear-web] in the product cybersecurity group doing a ton of different things. Everything is cyber. 


But lets just let the "cyber" be assumed in the following: Embedded security, security analysis & design, pen testing, and software development. 

It has been a blast!

Just this past August, Lear sent me to DEFCON26. I definitely recommend it for anyone who is into hacking/security/the cyber/gambling/desert heat. For those not "in the know," a "badge" means at least two things when talking about a "badge" from DEFCON: 

1) How you get into the CON without getting kicked out by GOONS; 

2) Electronic device meant for reverse engineering and "hacking." 

To enter, you purchase the main DEFCON badge. That's all you need, but you can also purchase badges some (all?) of the villages there. For those not "in the know," a "village" is just an area of the CON that focuses on a topic. Naturally, I purchased a badge from the [Car Hacking Village][chv-web]. 


I am will be writing a resource guide based on my experiences reverse engineering the CHV badge.
